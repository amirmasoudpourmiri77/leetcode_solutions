In this notebook, we'll explore how to merge two sorted arrays efficiently. We'll use pointers to keep track of positions in both arrays and modify the first array in-place.

## Problem Description

Given two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array.

- The number of elements initialized in `nums1` and `nums2` are `m` and `n` respectively.
- You may assume that `nums1` has enough space (size equal to `m + n`) to hold additional elements from `nums2`.
"""),
    nbf.new_markdown_cell("""
## Pointers

- **`i`**: Points to the last valid element in `nums1` (initially `m - 1`).
- **`j`**: Points to the last element in `nums2` (initially `n - 1`).
- **`k`**: Points to the last position in `nums1` (where the merged elements will go).

## Algorithm

### While Loop:

- Compare elements from the back (`nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`).
- Place the larger element at position `k` in `nums1`.
- Adjust the pointers (`i`, `j`, `k`) accordingly.

### Handling Remaining Elements:

- Since `nums1` already contains valid elements, only the remaining elements in `nums2` need to be copied.
- The loop handles this case by continuing until all elements from `nums2` are merged.

    nbf.new_markdown_cell("""
## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we're modifying `nums1` in-place without using additional space.
